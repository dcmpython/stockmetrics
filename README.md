# stockmetrics
This is my Gonzaga MSBA601 stock tickers and metrics development project. 

# Open source
This project is a public repository and is fully open source. Anybody can take this code and use it commercially as I claim no rights to this code.

# Python dictionaries

We use Python dictionaries to put some initial data (price and EPS TTM) into our dictionary. We use a for loop to calculate the P/E ratio. Right now they are on a trailing
twelve month basis (TTM) and I have plan to include forward EPS. I am looking into how to import prices and EPS estimates from third party sources like Finsheet.io, Yahoo Finance, Factset
or other traditional tools.

# User input

Right now the only user input is to select a stock and then see the information.

# Future menu

As I build this out, I hope to have a menu of choices for the user. Not just P/E TTM but maybe other P/E ratios or metrics. A sort of quick and dirty database for key metrics.
